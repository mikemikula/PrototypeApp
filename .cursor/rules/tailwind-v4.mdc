Simplified installation
We've streamlined the setup process a ton in v4.0, reducing the number of steps and removing a lot of boilerplate.

1. Install Tailwind CSS
npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss;
2. Add the PostCSS plugin
export default {
  plugins: ["@tailwindcss/postcss"],
};
3. Import Tailwind in your CSS
@import "tailwindcss";
With the improvements we've made to this process for v4.0, Tailwind feels more light-weight than ever:

Just one-line of CSS — no more @tailwind directives, just add @import "tailwindcss" and start building.
Zero configuration — you can start using the framework without configuring anything, not even the paths to your template files.
No external plugins required — we bundle @import rules for you out of the box, and use Lightning CSS under the hood for vendor prefixing and modern syntax transforms.
Sure you only go through this once per project, but it adds up when you're starting and abandoning a different side-project every weekend.
