# Salesforce Consultancy Project Overview

## Project Purpose
This is a **single-page marketing site** with lead generation capabilities for a Salesforce consultancy. The project requirements are defined in [prd.md](mdc:prd.md) and implementation steps in [prd-checklist.md](mdc:prd-checklist.md).

## Tech Stack (Next.js 15 + Modern Tools)
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** in strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with utility-first approach
- **Prisma 5** + **PostgreSQL 15**
- **pnpm** for package management (NEVER use npm)
- **react-hook-form** + **Zod** for form validation
- **Salesforce REST API** integration with OAuth2

## Core Functionality
1. **Hero Section**: Marketing content with compelling CTA
2. **Lead Form**: Captures visitor details (fullName, company, email, phone, projectBudget, message)
3. **Database**: Persists leads to PostgreSQL via Prisma
4. **Salesforce Integration**: Creates Lead records via REST API with retry logic
5. **Observability**: Error logging and performance monitoring

## Success Metrics
- API P95 latency < 250ms
- Form submission error rate < 0.1%
- WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance
- LCP < 1.8s on 4G networks

## Key Constraints
- Out of scope: CMS, blog, testimonials, multi-language support
- Security: Rate limiting (100 req/IP/min), environment variables for secrets
- Testing: Unit tests with Jest, e2e with Playwright
- CI/CD: `pnpm verify` must pass before deployment
